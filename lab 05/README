Introduction
------------

In this lab, you will be exploring trees, particularly red black trees.
This lab is divided into two parts - the first involves implementing
insertion into red black trees, while the second is an
involved, albeit optional, analysis of data structure isomorphism.

Please find both the problems in folder part1 and part2.
